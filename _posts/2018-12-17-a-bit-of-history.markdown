It was easy to work for a 75 year-old student publication and not really think much about where it came from. I had looked at old copies of _The Pacer_ in the back of the newspaper office, but mostly to laugh about how they used to produce a scandalous satirical insert every year titled _Le Pissoir_ in the 1970s and 80s. For a college student, everything was measured in those four or five year chunks of time, and little that came before or after it mattered.

Three years ago, I went back to the UT Martin campus for homecoming. I reached out to a few folks after that time to see about "freeing" the newspaper archives from the microfilm collection and getting them available online. It took a lot of emails (some of which were never returned) to finally get a bit of traction on it. Last summer I went back to campus and spent some time actually looking at the microfilm and saving a year or two worth of issues to a thumb drive. I went back to my hotel room and published the set to Archive.org.

Well, when you start doing something like that, you have to finish it.

I noticed that the one reel I had scanned came from the Tennesee State Library and Archives. Given that I live in Nashville, a trip over there would be a lot faster than a trip back to Martin. My first inquiry about whether they had a copy was not very encouraging. They had never heard of it, and it wasn't with their newspaper collection. As a last ditch effort, I sent them over a photo of the title card from the film, hoping it would help.

It did. The newspaper was not filed with the newspaper. It was filed with the manuscripts. More on that later.

I also found that the TSLA offered a digitization service. Fantastic, I thought, I can just throw money at the task rather than spending several weekends in the basement of a government building. I ordered a set of CDs around Thanksgiving and got them a few weeks later.

One thing you will notice is that the images are not very consistent, which the digital specialist assured me was a product of not-great imaging to start with. Whoever had put the issues to microfilm appears to have had a tough time with the task, so some issues are mostly illegible through the first few pages.

It took about a month to get all of _The Volette_ issues uploaded and available. The TSLA does not have the more recent microfilm of _The Pacer_ up to 2000. Those five reels, to my knowledge, only exist in Martin. Issues after 2000 are a bit harder to come by as they have not been microfilmed nor do all exist as the production PDFs.

The goal is to have every available issue online. My hope is that it provides a resource for researchers and the campus community at large.

Enjoy!
