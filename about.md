## About _The Volette_

_The Volette_ was the student newspaper at the [University of Tennessee at Martin](http://www.utm.edu) from 1928 to 1971. The institution changed names twice during the paper's run, first as the University of Tennessee Junior College and then the University of Tennessee Martin Branch.

In 1971, at the same time the university's athletic teams were being renamed as the UT Martin Pacers, the newspaper also became [_The Pacer_](http://www.thepacer.net/). Today it is published twice a month and distributed around campus.

## About this site

This site is a frontend for the press archives hosted at Archive.org. The archives were created from microfilm scans provided by the [Tennessee State Library and Archives](https://sos.tn.gov/tsla). It was created in November and December of 2018.

#### Why are some issues hard to read?

Many issues are overexposed on the original microfilm, likely a product of operator error. The scanning process in the Fall of 2018 was unable to significantly correct for the error, resulting in some pages (particularly the first few pages of several issues) being illegible. The original microfilm holdings at the TSLA and the [Paul Meek Library](https://www.utm.edu/library.php) may provide a better scan when viewed with the appropriate software.

#### Where is Volume 1, Issue 1?

While the newspaper began December 17, 1928, the microfilm scans did not contain this issue. The archive begins with Issue 2.

#### What about _The Pacer_?

The archives from 1971 to the present day are an ongoing process.

- **Issues from 1971 to 1985** are in progress and will be available [in the  Archive.org collection](https://archive.org/details/thepacer).
- **Issues from 1985 to 2000** have not yet been scanned from [microfilm available at the Paul Meek Library](http://library.utm.edu/record=b1334328).
- **Issues from 2000 to today** are not on microfilm. They exist as a combination of physical copies at UT Martin and production PDFs maintained by the newspaper staff.
