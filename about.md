## About _The Volette_

_The Volette_ was the student newspaper at the [University of Tennessee at Martin](http://www.utm.edu) from 1928 to 1971. The institution changed names twice during the paper's run, first as the University of Tennessee Junior College and then the University of Tennessee Martin Branch.

In 1971, at the same time the university's athletic teams were being renamed as the UT Martin Pacers, the newspaper also became [_The Pacer_](http://www.thepacer.net/). Today it is published twice a month and distributed around campus.
